# Ray-Tracing-Cornell-Box-C-Plus-Plus
Ray tracing is a process of rendering a scene by casting a ray from the camera to surface and then to the light source. In this repository, I have implemented a ray tracer to render a Cornell-box scene with advanced functionality like reflection, anti-aliasing, arbitrary point of view, adding checkerboard pattern in the image etc. Object Oriented Programming design was maintained in the development process. Furthermore, this ray tracer can render a scene, showed as shown in result image, of 25 samples per pixel within approximately less than a minute.
